  FileFix is a social-engineering lure that coerces users to paste a crafted
  string into the File Explorer address bar. The visible portion looks like a
  file path, but the copied content contains a hidden command (e.g., PowerShell)
  which executes when submitted.

      Demonstration only. Do not use real payloads. The goal is user education
      and detection validation. Use a harmless echo.
    steps:
      - "Open File Explorer"
      - "Copy this benign demo string: `powershell -nop -c echo DEMO`"
      - "Click the Explorer address bar, paste, and press Enter"
      - "Observe a harmless console window printing DEMO"

    mitigations:
      - "User education: never paste commands into Explorer address bar"
      - "Detect explorer.exe spawning powershell.exe/cmd.exe"

      The same address-bar behavior exists in Control Panel and many MMC shells.
      Use an ultra-safe demo (opens Notepad). For education only.
    steps:
      - "Open Control Panel (or an MMC console)"
      - "Click the address bar"
      - 'Paste: `notepad` and press Enter'
      - "Notepad opens"
